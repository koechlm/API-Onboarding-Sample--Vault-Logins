This sample provides code for the combination of client|server licensing and all three account authorization types. The sample comes with a user interface to start each authorization type, and you can step through the code behind each approach.

The license/authorization type, Autodesk Account Token/ID is not part of this sample; this type targets web applications without local client installation. The SDK provides a fully coded sample for this combination: review the Autodesk Vault <version 2022 or newer> SDK\VS19\CSharp\WebAppUseUserLicense solution.
Please respect the disclaimer and readme.

Sincerely,
